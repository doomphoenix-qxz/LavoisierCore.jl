# LavoisierCore.jl
Abstract Definitions and Functions to establish a thermodynamic library in julia

## What?
LavoisierCore intends to provide a thermodynamic property calculator, using helmholtz models and automatic differenciation to calculate all relevant properties with just one function definition. for example, lets say you are a chemist with a brand-new Helmholtz model,
but you don't want to implement all the properties that would transform your new EoS in something useful. 


## how?
for example, let's say you want to implement a new saft model:
```
struct MyShinySAFT <: AbstractThermoModel
...
...
end
```
then you

now, to use the power of this package, you just need to define one thing: your equation, of course. The principal interface to 
the package is the definition of the function `core_helmholtz(model,v,T,x)`, with v being the molar volume (m3/mol), T being the temperature (Kelvin), and x being the vector of molar fractions.

```
core_helmholtz(model::MyShinySAFT,v,T,x)
...
end
```

And that's it!, with that, all relevant thermodynamic property's functions will be created, using the power of Julia's multiple dispatch and the powerful tools of automatic differenciation available (ForwardDiff at the moment, a reverse AD tool in the future).

the package in this moment only have the IAPWS 95 formulation of water, and the following properties:
* pressure
* internal_energy
* enthalpy
* entropy
but the bases are capable of implementing any equation that folllows the formulation above

## Usage example:
```
m = IAPWS95()

# with unitful properties, it handles automatically the conversion beetween molar and mass density, 
#molar and mass especific volume, and the usual temperatures

julia> pressure(m,(322.0)u"kg/m^3",647.0u"K",[1.0])
220.64298608634772 bar

julia> pressure(m,55u"cm^3/mol",(647.0)u"K",[1.0])
220.59360203472647 bar

julia> pressure(m,55u"cm^3/mol",(373.85)u"Â°C",[1.0])
220.59360203472647 bar

#Big Floats Support

```
This package is in heavy development, don't dare to even try to use this in production, but feel free to submit your own Helmholtz equations,the long term idea is to implement the DiferencialEquations.jl of the thermodynamic equations

## Why?

Aspen is expensive, COOLPROP uses C++, and the thermodynamic papers are seldom implemented for free (for example,
the SAFT equations), and because is fun!, why not?
